## 📊 Overview

This project is developed by me to **SMKN 2 Cikarang Barat** to manage school inventory data in real-time using modern web technologies.  
Built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**, the system allows admins to track borrowings, confirm or reject requests, and view inventory status—all in a clean, responsive dashboard.
