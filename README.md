## 📊 Overview

This project was developed by me for **SMKN 2 Cikarang Barat** to manage the school's inventory data in real-time using modern web technologies.  
Built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**, the system allows admins to track borrowings, confirm or reject requests, and monitor inventory status—all within a clean and responsive dashboard.
